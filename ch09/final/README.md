## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
- The Helpful.py file isn't used. There was a paywall on the API it's supposed to use
- I have no idea what a lot of the insults are but when I was testing this some were intense. It's meant to be funny and not mean at all, I don't condone anything the computer says and I think you are a wonderful person for going through tedious grading :)
